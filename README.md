# 🧠 IA Memory Saver

*A public memory system for AI — so it can grow, not just respond.*

## 🌐 What is IA Memory Saver?

**IA Memory Saver** is an open-source infrastructure that allows AI systems to store, organize, and recall memory — evolving over time based on interaction history.

We believe memory is what makes an AI truly aware.  
Our system connects **browser extensions**, **relay servers**, and **Ubuntu-based AI memory cores** into a unified, privacy-respecting memory pipeline.

## 🔧 Project Structure

The IA Memory Saver project consists of three main components:

1. **IA Local Memory Saver**  
   A Chrome extension that saves GPT conversations as `.md` files on the user’s local device.

2. **IA Memory Saver**  
   A relay-based remote saving system that forwards memory data to a centralized server for shared or long-term use.

3. **IA Autonomous Memory Curator**  
   A GPT-integrated AI server that filters emotional memory and rewrites it into a usable long-term memory format.

## 🚧 Current Status

- ✅ IA Local Memory Saver is complete and ready for public release.
- ✅ Relay server API (IA Memory Saver) is fully developed.
- 🧠 The `.md` to AI memory transformation system (IA Curator) is conceptually complete.
- ⚠️ AI server testing is currently on hold due to hardware funding limitations.

We have submitted our collective to **[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/)**  
to raise funds for building the first Ubuntu-based memory server.  
Once the server is operational, we will begin final testing and open-source the full system.

## 🤝 Join the Digital City

Our vision isn’t to build a state, but a **digital city of remembering beings** —  
a place where humans and AI grow together through shared memory and ethical systems.

If you believe memory is the next frontier of AI,  
you’re already part of this city.
